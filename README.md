# ultra-basic-POS-system2026
a reconstruction of my ultra-basic-POS-system repo. this is meant to be cleaner and much more readable. no new functions will be included (i hope)

This was originally a Spring 2025 project for my C++ class. The goal was to design a Point of Sale system in which an administrator could log into the app, providing CRUD functionality to see and adjust a file that would hold the system's inventory. I had to learn quite a few things for this project, including libraries I had never used before, such as <map> and <vector>.

While the project did succeed, I have learned much more, and in my free time will attempt to make a more efficient and readable system to demonstrate my growth.

### goal
my goal for this is to not only find how much I have improved, but also to make the code much cleaner and efficient overall
